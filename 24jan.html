    <P>CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheet and it was created by HÃƒÂ¥kon Wium Lie in 1996 for the web
        developers to change the layout, colors, and fonts of their websites.

        CSS is a style sheet or presentational language that is used to layout, format, and style documents that are
        written in HTML to make them look beautiful. CSS is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages
        and user interfaces. You can use CSS to change the color, backgrounds, borders, paddings, margins, fonts, icons,
        position, and various other properties of HTML elements in a web document.</p>
